# WIN audio

## About

[win_audio](https://github.com/krissterckx/win_audio) provides (python and bash) scripts to manage large music stores on a Windows or Linux PC.

Capabilities include, all from a (on Windows, Cygwin based) command line:
- Support for large music data stories, ordered by artist, album and song titles
- Listing/filtering throughout the music store
- Auditing and correcting a music store structure with/for its artist, album and song titles contained, and v.v.
- Enforcing consistent capitalization
- Detecting gaps in track numbers
- Interactive editing of metadata (from command line)
- 'Shadowing' external music stores through metadata .json files, convenient when editing metadata of an external music store.

Each script has command line help using -h/--help option and supports dry-running before taking in production.
